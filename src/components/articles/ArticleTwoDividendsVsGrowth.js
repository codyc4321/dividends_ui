      <h3>Dividend vs. Growth stocks</h3>
      <p>One important distinction every new investor should understand is the advantages of either dividend or growth stocks.</p>
      <p>First we must understand what makes a dividend or growth stock. Companies go through 3 stages in their lifecycle: startup, growing, and finally, mature.</p>
      <p>In the startup phase, the company is not turning a profit, and it relies on outside funding, like selling equity to investors or taking out loans. Each month
      the company is losing money from operations but the founders are working hard to make it profitable. In this phase it is purely a growth stock but it is the most risky time
      to invest in a company.</p>
      <p>In the growing phase, the company is now profitable and is funding its own operations and possibly paying down debt. It does not pay a dividend yet,
      as leadership is reinvesting most of the profits into expanding and growing the company. The company is now likely stable, depending on how much debt it has,
      and is less risky an investment than a startup company.</p>
      <p>In the mature phase, after a startup becomes a profitable and growing company, many years later, it will absord all of the market share that its goods or
      services provided will allow. While it's possible the company can still grow, many mature companies either no longer grow or grow very slowly. This is because
      their marketing has already reached most of the people or companies that would be willing to use their services. The company has acquired the customers it can acquire,
      and at this point its best growth opportunities are mergers and acquisitions, spinning off child companies in different industries, going for a full vertical integration
      of its own supply chain, or developing an international presence if it didn't have one.</p>
      <p>Because mature companies are finding it difficult to keep growing, and they should do something with their profits, many decide to pay dividends to reward
      investors for their support and to make the company's stock more valuable. These large, mature, and profitible companies that pay dividends are the least risky
      stocks to invest in. The total returns you will earn may be lower than with growth stocks, but if safety is your main goal, mature companies may be for you.
      Remember, with less risk, there is usually less potential for large gains,</p>
      <h4>Which type of stock is best for me?</h4>
      <p>If you are decades away from being able to retire, growth stocks are your best bet, They offer much higher total return potential than the safer dividend companies.
      While you can also invest in some dividend stocks to balance your portfolio, choosing mostly growth stocks will net you the highest total return and the most comfortable
      retirement.</p>
      <p>For investors nearing retirement or in retirement, preserving their net worth is more important than quickly growing it. Losing a large portion of their
      portfolio's value would be catastrophic as they do not have the income from work to replace it. Also, they may need to sell stocks to pay bills since
      they are either working less or not working. The high volatility in growth stocks is not ideal for them, they prefer stable companies that won't see large declines in
      stock value. Also, they rely on the dividends paid to live off of.</p>
      <h4>Tax implications</h4>
      <p>Ordinary dividends are taxed as regular income on your yearly tax return. Qualified dividends are taxed a capital gains, Because most dividends are taxed as regular income,
      investors with a high income and high tax brackets will pay more in taxes from ordinary dividends. However, qualified dividends that are treated like capital gains
      are not taxed at all for investors who make less than $80,000 per year. Please see this &nbsp;
