    <p>There are many types of bonds, and at least 5 main types:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Treasury Bonds</li>
      <li>Savings Bonds</li>
      <li>Agency Bonds</li>
      <li>Municipal Bonds</li>
      <li>Corporate Bonds</li>
    </ul>

    <h5>Treasury Bonds</h5>
    <p>The most well-known, most common, and most important type of bond is U.S. Treasury bonds. Treasury "bonds" actually come in&nbsp;
    <a href="https://www.finra.org/investors/learn-to-invest/types-investments/bonds/types-of-bonds/us-treasury-securities" target="_blank">
      3 varieties</a>&nbsp;
    with different time durations:
    <ul>
      <li>Bills (short-term, 1 year or less)</li>
      <li>Notes (medium-term, 2-10 years)</li>
      <li>Bonds (long-term, 30 years)</li>
    </ul>
    The current rate of interest on Treasury bonds helps determine the coupon rate on all other types of bonds.
    Treasury bonds are considered the lowest risk bond possible, as they are guarenteed by the full
    faith and credit of the U.S. government. If the lowest risk bond (treasuries) is currently paying 3%, then higher risk bonds must pay more than 3% to
    attract potential investors. As the safest investment, they also have the lowest return.</p>
    <p>Treasuries are sold at auctions to accredited investors and companies, which then resell them to other companies or individuals in the secondary market.
    Large funds that need safe investments, such as most insurance companies, carry a lot of treasury bonds. The minimum value of a treasury bond is $100.</p>
