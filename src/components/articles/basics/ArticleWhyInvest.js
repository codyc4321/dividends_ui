    <p>Many people new to investing get intimidated and put off by the complexities involved with not only the terminology,
    but also the numerous asset classes you can invest in.<br/>
    Other new investors get scared off of investing due to the risks and numerous warnings that 'Investments are not insured by the FDIC. May lose value.'<br/>
    Some people save as much money as they can, but they don't invest any of it.</p>
    <p>Saving can possibly be guarenteed. Savings in FDIC insured banks are guarenteed by the Federal government up to $250,000.<br/>
    If you are able to use a savings account, you can earn some interest on your cash savings.<br/>
    The main risk of saving is that if inflation is higher than the interest you earn on your savings you will lose purchasing power over time.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>While saving is a very important use for money, investing is of great importance over your lifespan. Before discussing why to invest, first let's define investing.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p></p>
    <p>Investing is literally the act of using money to make more money. <br/>
    Let's look at the Merriam Webster definition of investing:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>to commit (money) in order to earn a financial return</li>
      <li>to make use of for future benefits or advantages</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Definition 2 is actually very relevant to this discussion because when we invest money we are giving up short term gratification (spending it) for&nbsp;
    the long-term advantages of growing it into more money. But while growing our money into more money may be our goal, investing has unique risks that saving doesn't have.</p>
    <p>Although investing carries the risk of losing money, many financial advisors consider <i>not</i> investing much more risky than investing for your chances at retirement.</p>
    Some of the risks of not investing include:
    <ol>
      <li>Money left in a bank loses value over time due to inflation</li>
      <li>Only having one source of income from work is dangerous if you get injured or are permanently disabled</li>
      <li>Pensions are not as stable as they used to be</li>
    </ol>
    <p>The truth is, money left in a bank tends to lose value over time due to inflation. While investing does have risk, prudent and wise investing is not very risky&nbsp;
    over a long time. Smart investments tend to earn a stable return over time if you wait out short-term fluctuations.
