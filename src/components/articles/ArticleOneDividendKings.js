      <h3>Dividend Kings and Aristocrats</h3>

      <p>Dividend kings and aristocrats are companies that not only consistently pay a dividend, but also consistently <i>raise</i> their dividend.</p>
      <p>The only requirement for a company to be a dividend king is to have raised their dividend every single year for 50 years in a row.</p>
      <p>The criteria to be a dividend aristocrat is more specific. First, the company must have raised their dividend every year for 25 years in a row.&nbsp;
      Also, the company must meet 3 specific attributes to be an aristocrat:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Must be a member of the S&P 500</li>
        <li>Must maintain liquidity of a daily stock trade value of $5 million for at least 3 months before entering the list</li>
        <li>Must maintain a total market cap of $3 billion (float-adjusted)</li>
      </ol>
      <p></p>
      <p></p>
      <p></p>
      <p></p>
      <p></p>
      <p></p>
      <p></p>
    </div>
